## elm-webpack-starter-kid

A very very basic elm 0.18 and webpack 4 boilerplate

Light & fast. Bare minimum of code. Up-to-date dependencies.

# TL; DR
```
git clone https://github.com/FranzSkuffka/elm-webpack-starter-kid \
npm i \
npm start
```

## Roadmap
- Component import example
- Semantic UI from CDN
